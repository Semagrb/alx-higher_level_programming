Tasks ðŸ“œðŸŽ€
0. Rectangle #0

0-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines an empty
class Rectangle.
1. Rectangle #1

1-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines a class
Rectangle. Adds a touch of elegance to 0-rectangle.js with:
Constructor that initializes instance attributes width and height with
given parameters w and h.
2. Rectangle #2

2-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines a class
Rectangle. Sprinkles a bit of charm on 1-rectangle.js with:
If provided w and h are less than or equal to 0, gracefully creates an empty object.
3. Rectangle #3

3-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines a class
Rectangle. Adds a dash of humor to 3-rectangle.js with:
Instance method print() that prints the rectangle using the X character.
4. Rectangle #4

4-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines a class
Rectangle. Continues the fun with 4-rectangle.js by:
Instance method rotate() that gracefully swaps the width and height of the Rectangle.
Instance method double() that adds a playful touch by multiplying the width and height of the
Rectangle by 2.
5. Square #0

5-square.js: JavaScript script that defines a class Square
that inherits from Rectangle. Introduces a whimsical Square class with:
Constructor taking one argument size.
6. Square #1

6-square.js: JavaScript script that defines a class Square
that inherits from Rectangle. Builds on the charm of 5-square.js with:
Instance method charPrint(c) that playfully prints the Square using the character
c. If c is undefined, it cleverly defaults to using the character X.
7. Occurrences

7-occurrences.js: JavaScript function that returns the
number of occurrences in a list. Adds a sprinkle of sparkle to your lists!
8. Esrever

8-esrever.js: JavaScript function that reverses a list. Because sometimes, you need a little rewind.
9. Log me

9-logme.js: JavaScript function that prints the number of
arguments already printed as well as the new argument value. A fun way to keep track!
Output: <number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>
10. Number conversion

10-converter.js: JavaScript function that converts a number
from base 10 to another base passed as an argument. Let's play with numbers in style!
11. Factor index

100-map.js: JavaScript script that imports an array and creates
a new array with each value equal to the value of the initial list times the index of
the new list. Prints both the initial and new list. Because math can be pretty too!
12. Sorted occurrences

101-sorted.js: JavaScript script that imports a dictionary
of occurrences by user ID and computes a new dictionary of user ID's by occurrences.
Prints the new dictionary. Let's organize the fun in a sorted way!
13. Concat files

102-concat.js: JavaScript script that concatenates two files
passed as arguments into a file specified as the third argument. Because sometimes, files are better together! ðŸŽ‰
