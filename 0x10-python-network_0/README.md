## 0x10. Python - Network #0

## üåê Overview

This repository is part of the \"Python - Network #0\" project, where you'll find a collection of scripts designed to interact with URLs, make HTTP requests, and process responses. From exploring various HTTP methods to finding peaks in unsorted integer lists, these scripts aim to provide practical solutions and insights into network-related tasks.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Display Body Size**: Takes in a URL, sends a request, and displays the size of the response body.

2. **GET Request Display**: Takes in a URL, sends a GET request, and displays the body of the response.

3. **DELETE Request Display**: Sends a DELETE request to the specified URL and displays the body of the response.

4. **Supported HTTP Methods**: Takes in a URL and reveals all HTTP methods accepted by the server.

5. **GET Request and Display**: Takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request, and displays the body of the response.

6. **POST Request Display**: Takes in a URL, sends a POST request, and displays the body of the response.

7. **Find Peak in Unsorted Integers**: Implements a function to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

## üìù Usage

You can use each script independently for specific network-related tasks. Follow the provided instructions and execute the scripts to observe their functionality.

## üìà Complexity Analysis

The \"find_peak\" script employs an algorithm with a specific time complexity, detailed in the corresponding text file (\`6-peak.txt\`). Understanding the efficiency of this algorithm is crucial for optimization considerations.
