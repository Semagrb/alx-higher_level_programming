## JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It enables dynamic content, form validation, and interactive elements within a web browser.

### Selector
Selectors are used to target specific elements within an HTML document. They are essential for manipulating elements using JavaScript or jQuery.

### Get and set content
JavaScript allows developers to retrieve and update the content of HTML elements dynamically. This capability is crucial for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

### Manipulate CSS classes
Manipulating CSS classes enables developers to dynamically change the appearance and behavior of HTML elements. JavaScript provides methods to add, remove, or toggle CSS classes based on user interactions or other events.

### Manipulate DOM elements
The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects. JavaScript enables developers to manipulate DOM elements, such as adding or removing elements, changing their attributes, or reordering them dynamically.

### API
JavaScript provides various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for performing tasks such as manipulating the DOM, making HTTP requests, handling events, and much more.
